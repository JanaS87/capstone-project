## Hello everyone and welcome to my capstone project:

# CAPP - Your cat food app

## What is my app about?

Little mind game: imagine you have several cats and you are standing in front of a big shelf of cat food and unfortunately you just don't know off the top of your head which of your cats liked or disliked a certain food. 

This is where my app comes in.
With **CAPP** you have all your cats at a glance. You can use the cat food search to see if one of your cats has already had that food and whether they liked it or not.
In the profiles of your cats you can see the age, if your cat has intolerances, diseases or allergies, which food had a high acceptance and which had a low acceptance.
Based on the health informations, you will also get cat food recommendations that your cat can try.

### Future plans include the following:

*An appointment planner*:

When important appointments, for example, at the vet are pending, these can be entered. These are then displayed to the cat.



*Database connection via cloud by means of a server*:

Each user gets their own login data for their very own profile. So they can be sure that no one else can access their cat data.

*Please enjoy my app in iPhone XR- view. Thank you ðŸ˜º*
